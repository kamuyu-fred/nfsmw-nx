 * Split large direct reads into pieces of this many MB. 0 = a single call.
 *
 * The worst case measured is a pread() of 19,932,032 bytes that takes 261.5 ms (there are 7 reads
 * over 8 MB, 169.2 ms on average). During those 261 ms the thread passes no point where the
 * scheduler can cleanly switch it out, and the per-file lock of XFile (file_lock_) stays held the
 * whole time.
 *
 * The cost of splitting can be bounded with the same data: fitting time = fixed + bytes/rate over
 * the 4.00 MB reads (59.8 ms on average, 21 samples) and the 19.01 MB reads (275.6 ms, 2 samples)
 * gives rate = 69.5 MB/s and fixed = 2.3 ms per call. So splitting 19 MB into 4 MB pieces is 4
 * extra calls = +9 ms over 275 (+3 %); 1 MB pieces would be 18 extra = +41 ms (+15 %). Hence 4
 * and not 1.
 *
 * In exchange, the worst pread drops from 261 ms to about 60, and short reads from the file system
 * are no longer visible: the loop keeps asking from where it stopped and only stops when a piece
 * returns 0 bytes (real end of file). The unsplit path returned the short read as it was.
 *
 * Measured: this does not raise FPS. Reads run on a thread other than the render thread, and outside
 * loading screens there is no correlation between slow reads and stutters. It is on because it
 * bounds the worst case and fixes short reads, not because a gain is expected.

/*
 * RAM read cache by blocks (nfsmw_io_cache_mb, off). The game rereads the same data from the SD
 * every lap.
 *
 * Measured over 5 minutes of racing (line `[io] rangos:`):
 *     from minute 2 on, between 79 % and 95 % of the bytes the game reads from disk had already
 *     been read before, and the sizes repeat with the lap period (20.9 MB three times, 13.0-13.6 MB
 *     twice...).
 * NFSMW streaming works per zone pack (eStreamingPack): on leaving a zone it releases the whole
 * pack and on entering again it asks for it again. We evict nothing (`0 desalojos` in every
 * report): the one releasing it is the game's memory manager, and it cannot be told no.
 *
 * What can be done is make the second time not cost a trip to the SD. In a race that is 441
 * reads, 181.5 MB and 4,447 ms inside read(), with single reads of up to 132 ms: until the pack
 * arrives, the facade shows the fallback texture, which is the "finishes loading when I get
 * close" effect seen on the console.
 *
 * 256 KB blocks with LRU. Missing blocks are read grouped, in a single pread per contiguous range,
 * so the first read costs the same as without the cache (not 36 calls for one of 9 MB) and later
 * ones are memcpy. Only read-only devices and files opened without write access: the game data
 * never changes.
 *
 * Sized at 64 MB: the unique bytes of a whole race are ~36 MB (181 MB with 80 % rereads), so the
 * whole circuit fits. 0 turns it off.
 *
 * ================================================================================================
 *  Off: on the console it does the opposite of what it promises.
 *
 *  Its own report on the console:
 *      304.6 MB delivered, 318.3 read from the SD, 1,053 blocks evicted
 *  It reads more disk than it saves. On the PC it gave 254 delivered against 217 read, which was
 *  misleading. The difference: on the console the race asks for more unique data than fits, the LRU
 *  evicts nonstop, and each 256 KB block is brought in to serve a small request and thrown away
 *  before it is reused. The 256 KB amplification per request eats the savings and more.
 *
 *  It also blocks: `g_cache_mutex` is a single mutex for all files and is held during the disk
 *  read. Any other reading thread waits behind it. (Careful when measuring: that time does not
 *  show in `[io] 15 s`, which only times inside read(); that line showed 32 ms per 15 s while the
 *  game crawled.)

/*
 * Read cache by exact range. This is the second attempt, not the block cache above.
 *
 * What was measured. Across two different builds the per-lap stutter pattern is identical: a period
 * of 62-68 s, three or four fixed places, always in the same order and with the same size. In those
 * frames the breakdown says GPU 27-29 ms (normal) and the `grabar` stage 0.2-0.4 ms: the time is
 * neither in the GPU nor in recording. What does go together with the big stutters are `[io] LENTO`
 * reads of NFS\ZZDATA6.BIN marked (RELEIDA), of 11 to 20 ms, and the worst one of the session
 * blocks for 132 to 140 ms. They are rereads of the zone pack: the game releases the pack on
 * leaving and asks for it again on entering, with the same offset and the same size.
 *
 * Why by range and not by blocks. The block cache above (nfsmw_io_cache_mb) failed on the console
 * because of the blocks: only 1 % of the offsets the game asks for are aligned to 256 KB, so it
 * brought 365 KB from the SD for every 110 KB requested (x3.3 amplification) and ended up reading
 * more disk than it saved. Storing the exact range (file, offset, bytes) makes the amplification
 * zero by construction: not a single byte the game did not ask for is read.
 *
 * 4 MB floor (first sizing; lowered below). Only requests of 4 MB or more got in. That leaves out
 * entirely the small requests, the ones that sank the previous attempt, and keeps exactly the
 * spikes the player notices.
 *
 * The numbers, simulated on the session logs: the slowest read of the race goes from 132.2 ms to
 * 29, and the 12 spikes of 80 ms or more go to 0. It costs 20.9 MB, 3 entries and 0 evictions.
 *
 * The cap cannot be lowered. With a 20 MB cap the result is zero spikes avoided: the three entries
 * do not fit, the LRU evicts them before they are reused and not a single hit is scored. It is a
 * cliff, not a slope, and it is exactly what sank the block cache. 32 MB and no less.
 *
 * Where that RAM comes from: the host heap (1,024 MB, runtime_switch.cpp), of which the guest
 * backing eats 506. Not the GPU budget, which is separate. That is why the first sizing stopped
 * at 32.
 *
 * The lock is not held across the disk read. The other failure of the block cache was that
 * g_cache_mutex, a single mutex for all files, stayed held inside the pread: any other reading
 * thread waited behind it, and that time did not show in `[io] 15 s` (which only times inside
 * read()). Here the lock is taken to look up the table and released before going to disk; the
 * data lives in a shared_ptr, so copying it needs no lock either, and an eviction cannot free the
 * buffer another thread is reading.
 */
/*
 * Resized from the race logs. The first version (cap 32, floor 4 MB) hit 25 % and saved 10 ms
 * per race. Two misreadings of the data:
 *
 * 1. The 34 evictions were not race data: they were the sequential sweep of the level load
 *    (34 blocks of ZZDATA0.BIN, 4 MB at a time, 154 MB, each read once). Raising the cap from 32
 *    to 128 did not buy a single hit. What is needed is not storing that sweep (see GuardarRango).
 * 2. The 4 MB floor did not see what repeats during a race, which is small: 62 distinct requests
 *    of 0.14 to 2.0 MB (24.7 MB in total), repeated 2 to 10 times each, almost all from
 *    ZZDATA6.BIN. Simulated on the real trace: floor 4 MB -> 16.6 % hits and 10 ms; floor
 *    256 KB -> 52.7 % and 1,132 ms saved per race. Footprint with that floor: 56.6 MB, so 64 MB
 *    is the first cap with 0 evictions, and above it nothing is gained.
 *
 * Memory: it comes from the host heap (1,024 MB), not from the GPU heap. With ~506 MB for the guest
 * and the thread stacks, 64 MB leaves margin; 128 would not in the pessimistic case.
