// nfsmw - who really draws the race shadow map
//
// ===========================================================================
//  The complete chain, read from the binary. Three levers failed because they all pointed at the same
//  place, and that place is the smallest of the three that draw.
//
//  sub_82443B18 is the shadow pass. It receives the one/two maps boolean in r4 and loops once per map
//  (r18 = 1 or 2) over views 13 and 14 (r26 starts at 0x82A38070 + 1456 = view 13 and advances 112
//  bytes). Within each iteration it draws with four different emitters, in this exact order
//  (nfsmw_recomp.55.cpp:16149, asm 299-438):
//
//    1. sub_824FA010(vista, 0x200000)   RenderWorldModels  -> WorldModels with bones
//    2. sub_824FA010(vista, 0x202000)   RenderWorldModels  -> WorldModels without bones
//    3. sub_824C3610(cull, vista, 512)  StuffScenery       -> scenery marked as caster
//    4. a loop over a global list (0x82C84D38: pointer at +4, count at +12) that calls virtual
//       method +12 of each element with (vista, 0). These are the entities: the cars.
//
//  All four end in the same function, sub_8243E358 = eViewPlatInterface::Render(eModel*, matrix,
//  light, flags, blend) (EcstasyData.hpp:232). It is the bottleneck all geometry goes through, which is
//  why it is measured there.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Why none of the three moved a single triangle
//
//  All three only touched emitter 3 (the scenery), and only the part of it that was already filtered.
//
//  a) nfsmw_sombras_lod (bit 0x1000 in cull_info+132) and nfsmw_sombras_lod_h (H in cull_info+192)
//     write into the SceneryCullInfo. The only reader is DrawAScenery, which only decides which
//     scenery enters the scenery draw list. Neither RenderWorldModels nor the car loop look at that
//     record: it does not exist for them.
//
//  b) On top of that, StuffScenery is called for shadows with stuff_flags = 512 (0x200), which
//     according to Scenery.cpp:1065-1095 sets exclusive_flags = 0x10000. With that, of the whole
//     scenery list the culling has just built, only what carries that bit is drawn, and only these
//     set it (Scenery.cpp:1131-1147):
//         (SceneryInst->ExcludeFlags & 0x200000) && !(ExcludeFlags & 0x4000000)   -> normal caster
//         (SceneryInst->ExcludeFlags & 0x40000000)                                -> forced caster
//     So the scenery that reaches the shadow map is a subset hand-marked by the artists. Lowering the
//     LOD of the whole list does not touch the few that pass the filter.
//
//  c) nfsmw_sombras_corte (PixelMinSize, vista+36) does target the right emitter (WorldModel::Render
//     uses it, WorldModel.cpp:313), but the value falls six times short. The cutoff is
//         distancia = 35 * (1 + H / PixelMinSize)          (eView.cpp:44-64, fixed radius 35)
//     and with the numbers measured on the console (H of view 13 = 9,146.3; H of the scene = 790.6;
//     PixelMinSize = ancho_destino * 0.009375, i.e. 15 in the map and 12 on screen):
//         scene     (H 790.6  P 12)  -> culls at   2,341 units
//         map       (H 9146.3 P 15)  -> culls at  21,376 units     9.1 times farther
//         map with nfsmw_sombras_corte = 150 (P 22) -> culls at 14,583 units
//     All of Rockport fits within 14,583 units: that is why that cvar comes out inert. The lever
//     exists; the number is just absurd for the H of a shadow view.
//
//  d) nfsmw_sombras_mapas (1 map instead of 2) is something else and lives in nfsmw_recorte_sombras.cpp.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  C7 read: the shadow map has no fat to trim by LOD. Closed.
//
//  Measured breakdown of view 13 (view 14 always shows 0 draws: nfsmw_sombras_mapas leaves a single
//  map). Per-frame averages over 17 race reports (and 15 more from a build that already had C7 but
//  not this lever, so there is a clean A/B):
//
//      emitter                  draws   k triangles   % of triangles
//      world with bones           0.0          0.00         0.0 %
//      static world               5.0          0.21         0.6 %   <- what the lever targeted
//      scenery                  186.4         12.52        35.6 %
//      cars and the rest         77.7         22.41        63.8 %
//      TOTAL                    269.1         35.15
//
//  Fourth failed lever, and for the same reason as the previous three: the wrong emitter. This time
//  the mechanism was right (WorldModel::Render does read PixelMinSize, and the log confirms the write
//  22 -> 72), but that whole emitter is worth 0.6 % of the map. The A/B:
//      without -> with:  WorldModel drawn 3.73 -> 5.00 | mundo-resto 0.16 -> 0.21 k triangles
//                        whole map (C7) 31.89 -> 35.15 k | shadows (C6) 63.3 -> 67.5 k
//  Everything goes up instead of down; they are two different laps, so the delta is noise, but the
//  conclusion does not depend on the noise: there are not even 0.2 k triangles to save there.
//
//  And the top ten solids by name say the other two emitters have nothing either:
//    - The player's car alone is 45 % of the top ten: "RX8_KIT00_BODY_A" 4,622 tris in ONE draw and
//      "RX8_BASE_A" 1,354, i.e. 5.98 k = 17 % of the whole map in TWO draws. The "_A" is the LOD:
//      the hero enters the shadow map with the highest-detail mesh. And it cannot be lowered:
//      CarRenderInfo::Render does car_body_lod = bMin(mMaxLodLevel, bodyLodIx + mMinLodLevel) and
//      for CarRenderUsage_Player (RideInfo, CarInfo.cpp:814-818) mMin == mMax, so neither the pixel
//      size nor ForceCarLOD (which also goes through bClamp(min,max)) moves it. Getting "_A" rather
//      than "_B" with mMin==mMax==B in the PS2 decomp is precisely the proof that the 360 binary
//      pins it even higher.
//    - The other cars already come in the low mesh: without the hero there are ~76 draws with
//      16.4 k, i.e. 215 triangles per draw. With the H of view 13 (9,146) and the light ~2,000 units
//      away, car_pixel_size comes out ~11 and the CarBodyLodSwapSize ladder {120,25,20,10,0} already
//      puts them on the last step. There is no lower step.
//    - The scenery is "XT_" (vegetation: TREELINE, REDWOOD, POPLAR, JUNIPER, HEDGE, BUSH_FOREST) and
//      "XB_" (buildings: HAPARTMENT, CP_APARTMENT, COLONIALHSE, BEACHHOTEL), almost all "_DEINST",
//      which are already merged batches. Their 186 draws average 67 triangles: hundreds of tiny
//      instances (XT_REDWOODL 26 tris/draw over 54 draws, XO_OVERPASS 16, XO_CRASHBARREL 48). The
//      big ones left are the merged batches, and those are the subset the artists hand-marked as
//      casters: exactly what was already found inert twice.
//
//  In short: of the map's 35 k triangles, 6 k are a car pinned by design, 16 k are cars already at
//  their worst mesh and 12.5 k are hundreds of 67-triangle instances. The ceiling of everything that
//  could be trimmed by LOD is ~6 k guest triangles (~11.5 k real, given the 1.92 factor between C7
//  and C6) = 0.64 ms, and getting it would mean ruining the player car's shadow. Not touched. Any
//  reduction of the pass's 3.5 ms has to come from something other than geometry: the 5.12 Mtexels
//  it opens or the vegetation's alpha material.
//
//  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  How the breakdown is measured
//
//  The right lever differs per emitter:
//      world      -> PixelMinSize of view 13/14 (what nfsmw_sombras_mundo_corte does)
//      scenery    -> cull_info (already tried, moves nothing)
//      cars       -> not possible with PixelMinSize: the game exempts views 13 and 14 on purpose.
//                    CarRender.cpp:2814 says literally
//                        if (car_pixel_size < view->GetPixelMinSize())
//                            if ((unsigned)(view->ID - 13) > 1) return false;
//                    so in views 13 and 14 the car is always drawn, however small. For cars the
//                    lever is the LOD passed to CarRenderInfo::Render (tireLOD and carLOD
//                    parameters), not the size.
//
//  The breakdown is measured in sub_8243E358 because all four pass through it, and it is attributed
//  with a thread mark set by the RenderWorldModels and StuffScenery hooks. The triangles come from the
//  model itself: eModel+0x0C = eSolid, eSolid+0x14 = NumPolys (int16), eSolid+0xA0 = name
//  (Ecstasy.hpp:15 and 95). Only fields the game dereferences in that same call are read, and after
//  it has done so, so no memory the game does not touch can be touched.
//
//  What the log says (the "C7" line), every 10 s and per frame:
//    - per view (13, 14 and view 1 as reference) and per emitter: draws and k triangles
//    - how many WorldModels were examined and how many were drawn (the rest were culled by the game
//      or by this lever): this shows at a glance whether nfsmw_sombras_mundo_corte bites
//    - how many times CullView runs with a cull_info of views 13/14 and how many SceneryDrawInfo it
//      leaves in its list. If it is 0, the scenery is not even culled for the shadow map; if it is
//      large but the "escenario" emitter draws little, the caster filter of StuffScenery is what
//      trims, not the LOD.
//    - the 10 solids that put the most triangles into the map, by name. That tells whether it is a
//      car, a building or vegetation, with no interpretation.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  The lever that was tried: nfsmw_sombras_mundo_corte -> off (0), measured to have no effect
//
//  It is the PixelMinSize of views 13 and 14, but expressed in world units, which is the only thing
//  that can be reasoned about. It is computed by inverting the formula above:
//
//      PixelMinSize = 35 * H / (corte - 35)          H read from the view in that same frame
//
//  It is written right before RenderWorldModels and the original value is restored right after, so
//  it does not overwrite nfsmw_sombras_corte (which writes the same field from the pass hook) and it
//  does not touch any other view or pass. And it only tightens: if the computed value is lower than
//  the current one, nothing is written.
//
//  Why it was set to 4500 and why it is now 0.
//  The safety reasoning was correct (and so was the write: the log confirms it), but the emitter it
//  targets contributes 0.6 % of the map's triangles. Culling something that costs nothing gains
//  nothing, and background shadows are lost in exchange. It stays at 0.
//
//  The scene stops drawing an object beyond 2,341 units from the scene camera. The light camera is
//  2,000 units away from it (measured on the console: the scene looks from (539, 4549, 230) and the
//  map from (1029, 3694, 1971)). By the triangle inequality, an object the scene draws is at most
//  2,341 + 2,000 = 4,341 units from the light. With the cutoff at 4,500 no object visible on screen
//  loses its shadow: only shadows of things the scene no longer draws are lost. With 15 the map
//  reached 21,376 units, 4.8 times farther than needed.
