// nfsmw - shadow trimming: update the shadow maps 1 of every N frames
//
// ===========================================================================
//  Why
//  In the menu and in a race, the two 1600x1600 shadow maps are more than
//  half of each frame's resolve area (~5.6 of ~9.9 screens) and, in a race,
//  ~584 of ~1,820 draws. It is an optional trade of image quality for FPS.
//
//  The pass (recompiled code)
//    sub_82443B18  shadow pass. Called by sub_82445660 (race) and
//                  sub_82444D80 (menus). It leaves its parameters in globals
//                  and queues on the render queue (sub_823C8378) the commands
//                  for one or two shadow maps; in a race it draws both within
//                  the same call, it does not alternate between frames.
//  If a frame does not call it, the maps keep what was last drawn and the
//  scene uses them anyway: the shadow lags behind.
//
//  What this file does
//  With nfsmw_sombras_cada = N (1..8) only 1 of every N calls goes through.
//  With 1, the default, it behaves like the game. It applies immediately,
//  also from the settings menu (L+R+Right, NFSMW category), to compare live
//  with the F3 counter.

/*
 * The 30 FPS guard.
 *
 * The goal is not a fast average: it is that no frame drops below 30. With FIFO presentation that is
 * binary: if the work does not fit in 33.3 ms, the frame slips to the next vblank and shows for 50 ms.
 * There is no middle ground.
 *
 * What this cannot do: degrade the frame in flight. By the time its cost is known it has already been
 * recorded, submitted and is being presented. No mechanism can save the first spike. What it does prevent
 * is staying below 30 for a sustained period: as soon as the average of the last frames approaches the
 * ceiling, the next frame already carries less work.
 *
 * The lever is the shadow, and it is the only one: it is the only lever with the three properties needed.
 * It is decided at the start of the frame, on the guest thread, and it is a whole block.
 *
 * Why there is no flicker. An earlier version had a step that updated the shadows 1 of every 3 frames. On
 * the console the guard went to the top step and stayed there 99 % of the time (the work did not fit by a
 * long way), so skipping frames stopped being an occasional lifeline and became the normal state: the
 * shadows flickered, and it was obvious at first sight.
 *
 * So skipping shadow frames is not part of the ladder. The remaining steps change the shadow but do not
 * make it flicker:
 *   1. one map instead of two  -> the second one freezes, it does not flicker
 *   2. no cast shadows         -> less visible, but consistently so
 *
 * And stepping down requires 30 s with margin, not 2: oscillating every two seconds between "with
 * shadows" and "without shadows" looks worse than the drop it fixes.
 *
 * It is also the test. The report says which step it was on and how many times it had to act. If it says
 * "step 0 100 % of the time, 0 raises", the work fit easily and the guard was not needed. If it says
 * anything else, it tells exactly how much was missing.

/*
 * Distance culling of what goes into the shadow map.
 *
 * The cost of the shadow pass follows triangles, not draws. The first regression, over 22 intervals and
 * reproduced in two builds with loads 2.6x apart, gave 10,000 triangles = 0.80 ms real. The map draws
 * 90,000 triangles per frame, more than the visible image (67,000), at twice the triangles per object.
 * That is why shrinking the map did not help (-44 % area gave -9 % time): area is not the problem.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The figure above is outdated. The right one is 0.556 ms real per 10,000 triangles.
 *
 * New regression over 17 ten-second race intervals in which the open area is constant (5.12 Mtexels =
 * the two 1600x1600 maps, 2.0 passes), so the only thing that varies is the triangle count:
 *
 *     ms_crudo = 0.03420 x k_triangulos + 0.023        r2 = 0.982   (51 to 96 k triangles)
 *     -> x1.627 -> 10,000 triangles = 0.556 ms real
 *
 * The drop from 0.80 is expected: the translator's branch merging (1806 -> 641 branches) came in between.
 * The cvar descriptions that promised savings based on 0.80 were inflated 1.4x; they are corrected below.
 *
 * The same fit answers the ZCULL question: the intercept is 0.023 ms raw = 0.037 ms real. So with both
 * 1600x1600 maps open and zero triangles the pass costs nothing measurable. The whole pass is geometry.
 * For contrast, the same fit against draws gives r2 = 0.404 and an intercept of 2.44 ms real, a model
 * with no physical meaning. The triangle count rules, and only it.
 *
 * ZCULL rejects fragments, not triangles: it does not touch setup, vertices or recording. Its ceiling in
 * this pass is those 0.037 ms. Even with the most generous bound (the map scale test, where -44 % area
 * gave -9 % time, so at most 20 % of the pass is per-fragment work: 0.74 ms real), ZCULL could only
 * remove the hidden fraction of that, and without near-to-far draw order from the light it would only
 * catch about half of it. Realistic ceiling: 0.1-0.25 ms. In exchange TRANSFER_DST would have to be
 * removed from the map, which is what disqualifies it in the driver, and that costs the 1600x1600 swap
 * (2.36 ms measured). Net loss, 10 to 1. The details are in nfsmw_nativo_destinos.cpp, next to the
 * TRANSFER_DST decision. Not to be reopened without new data.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Where the lever is, read from the binary. `WorldModel::Render` decides whether to draw with
 *
 *     eView::GetPixelSize(pos, 35.0f) < view->PixelMinSize   ->  not drawn
 *
 * and `GetPixelSize` returns `radio * H / (distancia - radio)`. So the cutoff distance is
 *
 *     35 * (1 + H / PixelMinSize)
 *
 * `PixelMinSize` is field +36 of the view (view 13 at 0x82A38644 and view 14 at 0x82A386B4, view table at
 * 0x82A38070 with 112 bytes per entry) and the game recomputes it every frame in sub_8243EC28, so it has
 * to be written afterwards: right here, in the pass hook, which runs after that recomputation and before
 * drawing.
 *
 * Raising it shortens the distance at which an object stops casting a shadow. Shadows of small, distant
 * objects are lost, which are the least visible ones; nearby ones are untouched.
 */

/*
 * Where the extra triangles are: the shadow map does not reduce detail.
 *
 * Counted over 22 intervals, summing whole frames:
 *     shadow map       2,948 draws   1,193 k triangles  ->  405 triangles per draw
 *     visible scene   16,770 draws   1,321 k triangles  ->   79 triangles per draw
 * The shadow map puts 5.1 times more triangles per object than the visible image, and it takes 47 % of all
 * the frame's triangles with 15 % of the draws.
 *
 * And the split appears exactly when the race starts. In the menu and the first intervals the ratio is
 * 0.79x, 0.83x, 0.85x, 1.05x (the same detail in both); as soon as the car is driven it jumps to 2.9x,
 * 3.5x, 6.8x, 7.8x, 8.1x. That is exactly the signature of the scene lowering mesh detail with distance
 * and the shadow map not doing so: in the menu almost everything is close and both match.
 *
 * So the shadow pass is not expensive because it draws too much, but because it draws each object with
 * the full-detail mesh when its shadow covers four pixels. The lever is not removing objects: it is using
 * the same reduced mesh as the scene. That is not decided here (the native renderer only sees GPU
 * registers, with no object id or mesh level); it is decided in the guest.
 *
 * What does not work, so it is not repeated:
 *   - Filtering by the draw's triangle count: it would remove simple-mesh objects, which are exactly the
 *     cheapest ones. The opposite of what is needed.
 *   - Shrinking the map (nfsmw_nativo_sombras_escala): the pass area is worth 0.037 ms.
 *   - ZCULL: it rejects fragments, and there is no fragment cost here to reject.
 */
/*
 * The default is 150 (it was 100), for this reason.
 *
 * Measured in a race: the shadow map pushes 65.7 k triangles per frame, almost as many as the visible
 * scene (68.9 k), and it does so with 153 draws against the scene's 922. That is 405 triangles per object
 * against 79. The shadow map does not lower mesh detail with distance and the scene does: in the menu,
 * where everything is close, both match (0.79x-1.05x); as soon as the car is driven, the ratio jumps to
 * 2.9x, 6.8x, 8.1x.
 *
 * In other words, the pass draws every car and every building with the full-detail mesh to cast a shadow
 * that covers four pixels. At 0.556 ms real per 10,000 triangles, those 65.7 k are 3.65 ms of the 3.69
 * measured: the pass is geometry and nothing else.
 *
 * 150 shortens the distance at which an object stops casting a shadow to two thirds. Shadows of small,
 * distant objects are lost (the least visible ones); nearby ones are untouched. It stays at 150 rather
 * than 200 because a shadow that pops in as you approach is noticeable, and the game must keep looking
 * right. The log says how many triangles it removes ("k triangulos" in the C6 line of area per render
 * target type).

 * Where it is written. The game recomputes it in sub_8243EC28 (`fctiwz` + `stfiwx` on vista+36), which
 * sub_82441100 calls once per active view per frame with the view in r4. So the hook goes on that function
 * and writes afterwards: the value read there is always the freshly recomputed one, never ours, and so,
 * unlike the shadow cutoff, there is no need to save the original here: an absolute value is written and
 * it cannot compound itself.
 *
 * Why it defaults to 0 (= like the game) and not to a higher value. The scene costs 22.55 ms real and it
 * is fragment shading: 6.5 M fragments over 0.92 M pixels. An object removed by the threshold is, by
 * definition, one that covers fewer than PixelMinSize pixels: going from 4 to 6 removes objects of at
 * most 36 pixels each. Even if 300 objects per frame went away (a quarter of the 1,207 the scene draws),
 * that would be 11 k fragments out of 6.5 M: 0.17 %, 0.04 ms. On the GPU this gains nothing, and the GPU
 * is what needs fixing in the scene pass.
 *
 * What it does gain is CPU: at 10.0 us per draw measured, 300 fewer draws are ~3 ms of CPU per frame. But
 * in a race the frame is GPU-bound (49.7 ms real GPU against ~29 of CPU), so those 3 ms do not turn into
 * a single FPS except in the alley stretches, which are CPU-bound.
 *
 * And what it costs visually. The distance at which an object of radius R disappears is
 * R * H / PixelMinSize. Raising the threshold does not suddenly erase distant objects: it brings that
 * distance closer in inverse proportion, so from 4 to 6 the cutoff distance drops 33 % for every object.
 * At 200 km/h (55 m/s) that means an object pops in about one second of travel closer than it does now,
 * and popping is the first thing anyone notices. On top of that the shadow map has its own cutoff
 * (nfsmw_sombras_corte): if the scene culls before the shadow does, the shadow of a missing object remains.
 *
 * So the lever exists, is in place and measured, but shipping it enabled would trade graphics for FPS
 * that do not materialize. The values:
 *
 *   value   cutoff distance       what is lost
 *   ------  --------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------
 *     4     like the game         nothing
 *     5     -20 %                 only what no longer reaches 4 output pixels: the scene draws at
 *                                 1280x720 and is resolved to 1024x576, so the game's 4 pixels
 *                                 are 3.2 in what is shown. The only value with a real argument.
 *     6     -33 %                 street furniture starts visibly popping in at mid distance
 *     8     -50 %                 clearly visible; only for measuring the savings ceiling
 *
 * The first time through, the view's H and the actual cutoff distance for each value are logged.
