// nfsmw - graphics work trimming during a race
//
// ===========================================================================
//  Why
//  Under Xenos emulation, a race ran at ~3 FPS with ~3,200 draws per frame,
//  at ~10,000 per second: every draw cost the same regardless of its pass.
//
//  How the game renders a race (recompiled code)
//    sub_824411B8  per-frame render: calls sub_82441100 and then
//                  sub_82445660.
//    sub_82441100  sub_8243FF30 enables views 1-5: byte +8 of each view
//                  in the table 0x82A38070 (112 bytes per view). In single
//                  player mode views 1 (scene) and 4 (reflection) remain.
//                  Then sub_824E4A20 -> sub_8243C6E0 enables the 6 faces of
//                  the car cubemap (pointers at 0x82A47E70) according to the
//                  row (counter 0x82A2CF24 % N of 0x828FB964) of the table
//                  0x828FBA88. It only prepares the views 1-17 that are active.
//    sub_82445660  with state 6 (0x82A39AD8) and no video, in this order:
//                  1600x1600 shadows, 640x360 road reflection (views
//                  4 and 5), 256x256 cubemap (views 18-23) and main view.
//    sub_824442E0  reflection pass: returns without doing anything if
//                  byte +8 of view 4 is 0.
//    sub_82444688  cubemap pass: skips each face whose byte +8 is 0.
//
//  What this file does, only in a race (state 6)
//  1. After sub_8243FF30, with nfsmw_reflejo_carretera = false, it disables
//     views 4 and 5 before they are prepared: they are not prepared, drawn or
//     resolved. The reflection texture keeps whatever it last held.
//     Not used on the Switch: the water samples that reflection, and the
//     sea in the coastal area came out black.
//  2. After sub_8243C6E0, with nfsmw_cubemap_caras_max = k (0..6), it leaves
//     at most k faces active per frame and rotates which ones, so all of
//     them get updated. With -1 it keeps the game's choice. The faces in
//     nfsmw_cubemap_caras_siempre do not count toward that limit: they are
//     updated every frame.
//  Outside a race it touches nothing: menus and garage stay as in retail.
//
//  The rear-view mirror
//  In a console recording the mirror refreshed ~6 times per second with the
//  scene at ~30: the game enables the 6 faces every frame (a single row,
//  "1 1 1 1 1 1") and with a 1-face limit each one is refreshed 1 of every
//  6 frames. The mirror comes from one of those faces.
//  - Pinning face 1 (view 19, mask 2), based on a misread diagnostic, left
//    the mirror just as slow on the console.
//  - Measured frame by frame on the PC (window recording and draws per copy
//    from C2): it comes from face 2, view 20, which C2 resolves into surface
//    07517000, and it is the most detailed one (380-530 draws; the others
//    7-90). With view 19 pinned it is refreshed 1 of every 5 frames; with
//    view 20 pinned (mask 4), every frame.
//  - Mask 4 costs ~+270 draws per frame in a race. With it the mirror was
//    confirmed fixed on the console, with the race at 26-31 FPS. It is the
//    default on the Switch.
//
//  How to disable it without a new build
//  In nfsmw.toml:   nfsmw_reflejo_carretera = true (already the default)
//                   nfsmw_cubemap_caras_max = -1
//                   nfsmw_cubemap_detalle_minimo = 0
//
//  ===========================================================================
//  What is really behind the two profile lines (race)
//
//  The C2 profile says "reflejo 0.95, 320 (cubo y desenfoque) 2.53" raw,
//  that is 1.55 and 4.12 ms real (x1.627). Both labels are misleading:
//
//  1) "reflejo" is not the road reflection. The category is decided by the
//     render target width (CategoriaDeDestino in nfsmw_nativo_dibujos.cpp):
//     everything with a pitch between 640 and 1279 lands there. What really
//     lands there is the 1024x576 output buffer (pitch 1040, height 576 =
//     599,040 texels), two passes per frame: 2 x 599,040 = 1.20 Mtexels,
//     which is exactly what C6 logs ("reflejo 1.20 Mtexels en 2.0 pases")...
//     and it logs the same in the menus, where there is no road and no
//     reflection. With 68 draws per frame in a race and 4 in the menu: it is
//     the final composite plus the HUD.
//     The road reflection (640x360, views 4 and 5) was off on the Switch in
//     this measurement and does not appear in any profile line: it was not
//     drawn, not resolved and cost nothing. Lowering its resolution or
//     alternating frames saves nothing because there is nothing to lower.
//     Turning it on costs ms; leaving it off is a visual difference from the
//     Xbox 360 (it is on now, see nfsmw_reflejo_carretera).
//
//  2) "320 (cubo y desenfoque)" is two different things mixed by pitch:
//     - The cubemap faces: 256x256 with pitch 320 (aligned to 80) = 81,920
//       texels per pass. Two faces are drawn per frame (C2 "caras
//       resueltas": each of the five that rotate shows up 41-52 times per
//       ~10 s, that is one per frame among the five, plus the pinned one).
//     - The bloom chain: one 512x288 pass (pitch 560, also lands here) and
//       three or four at 256x144 (pitch 320). Its 128x72 siblings (pitch
//       160) land in "menores".
//     Measured breakdown of the race frame (0.51 Mtexels, 6.2 passes, 311
//     draws, 4.12 ms real), with the known cost of 0.874 ms of GPU per 100
//     draws:
//       * the 311 cubemap face draws: ~2.7 ms  (66 %)
//       * the 6.2 open passes and their tile load: ~0.9 ms
//       * filling the 0.51 Mtexels: ~0.4 ms
//     So the cubemap does not cost pixels, it costs draws. Lowering the face
//     resolution barely touches those 2.7 ms; removing objects does.
//
//  3) The radial blur is no longer paid for. The real one (acceleration and
//     NOS) is 7 of the 12 samples of the composite quad (p_000139), and
//     nfsmw_nativo_sin_desenfoque removes it by default (1.5-2.0 ms real).
//     The log shows it applied: the specializations of those pipelines carry
//     bit 19 (0x80000). The seven samples read the same texture as the
//     center one (DIFFUSEMAP, the scene), not a separate chain, so removing
//     it leaves no orphan pass to cut. What remains in the "320" bucket is
//     not that blur: it is the bloom, and that one is visible.
