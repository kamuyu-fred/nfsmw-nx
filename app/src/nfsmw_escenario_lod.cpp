// nfsmw - scenery switched meshes while still large on screen
//
// WHAT IT FIXES
//   The mesh switch of the scenery (ScenerySectionHeader::DrawAScenery). Each SceneryInfo
//   has pModel[4] (Scenery.hpp:173, offset 0x28); the game chooses between pModel[0] (full) and
//   pModel[2] (reduced). Each eModel carries its own eSolid and its own pTextureTable, so
//   the switch changes geometry and texture, and it is a pointer swap without a fade: pop.
//
// WHERE IT IS IN THE RECOMPILED BINARY
//   sub_824C2850 = ScenerySectionHeader::DrawAScenery   app/generated/default/nfsmw_recomp.70.cpp:18095
//     :18292  call to sub_824C2720 (InlinedViewGetPixelSize) -> returns pixel_size in r3
//             and writes the distance to the camera into the float r6 points to
//     :18391  lfs f7,80(r1)      <- that distance
//     :18395  lfs f13,3552(r27)  <- constant at 0x82062AC8 (r27 = 0x82061CE8)
//     :18410  blt -> 0x824C2A88  <- if distance < K: full mesh, nothing else is checked
//     :18412  lfs f13,-4396(r27) <- the 8.7f, at 0x82060BBC
//     :18417  blt -> 0x824C2AC8  <- if pixel_size/max(Density,6) < 8.7: reduced mesh
//   sub_824C2720 = InlinedViewGetPixelSize              app/generated/default/nfsmw_recomp.4.cpp:18706
//   A single caller in the whole binary: nfsmw_recomp.70.cpp:18292, inside DrawAScenery.
//
// WHY THE HOOK IS HERE AND NOT IN DrawAScenery
//   The distance sub_824C2720 writes is only read in that comparison. The return value
//   (pixel_size) is not touched, so neither the 18 px cutoff nor the branches for the
//   rear-view mirror / cubemap / shadows (which go by ExcludeFlags 0x1800 and 0x20 and do not
//   look at the distance) move.
//   Possible side effects: none outside the full/reduced choice for the filtered view.

/*
 * Why -1 and not 150.
 *
 * Measured on screenshots and on video frames: the switch happens when the object covers a radius of
 * ~159 px, i.e. a third of the screen. The 52.2 px that comes out of the formula is only the floor (8.7 x
 * the minimum of 6.0); the real threshold is 8.7 x Density, and that garage door has Density ~18-19. That
 * is why it is so visible.
 *
 * And the geometry is worse than it seemed: an object is drawn from r*H/18 and is only on the full mesh
 * from r*H/(8.7*D), so the fraction of area on the full mesh is (18/(8.7*D))^2 = 11.9 % with the minimum
 * Density and 1.1 % with Density 19. Between 88 % and 99 % of what is visible is on the reduced mesh.
 *
 * With 150 units the switch is pushed away from where the eye is, but there is still a switch. The aim
 * was to make the effect disappear, not to disguise it, so the value was -1.
 *
 * The cost, which is the risk: the extra triangles on the same objects cost almost nothing (same
 * silhouette, same fragments, and the scene is ALU-bound: TMU 51 %, ROP 8 %). The estimate is 0.2-0.6 ms.
 * What could cost something is draws: if the full mesh brings more materials, that means more draw calls
 * at ~12 us of CPU each, and that gets expensive. It shows in "C7" and "C6 dibujos" in the log.
 *
 * If it turns out expensive: lower it to 150 in the toml (it covers everything that looks large, for
 * tenths of a ms) or to 0 to go back exactly to the game's behavior.
 */
/*
 * Off. The hypothesis was wrong, and this is measured.
 *
 * With the hook reaching 100 % of the objects (the log says "8.684.579 que el juego dibuja, 8.684.579
 * con la malla buena forzada"), the scenery triangles did not move (37.1 k without the hook against
 * 39.5 k with it, and that 6 % is driving noise). Forcing the full mesh changes nothing because there is
 * almost never a better mesh to choose.
 *
 * The reason is in the game itself: if an object has no detail model of its own, loading the section
 * copies the same pointer into all four levels (nfsmwdecomp, src/Speed/Indep/Src/World/Scenery.cpp:401-421:
 * "if pModel[2] is null and pModel[1] is not, pModel[2] = pModel[1]", and likewise for pModel[0]). So
 * pModel[0] and pModel[2] are the same eModel, with the same eSolid and the same texture table.
 *
 * What is visible on screen is not this. It is that the detailed scenery section arrives late: while it
 * is missing, the distant stand-ins of the 'Z' sections are drawn (Scenery.cpp:927), and when the section
 * comes in the full object appears all at once. The popping and the stutter are the same event. The lever
 * is the streamer's anticipation (see nfsmw_streaming_anticipacion.cpp).
 *
 * The hook, the cvar and the counters stay because they were hard to find and the per-caller breakdown
 * is still useful; but the default is 0 = the game decides, which is what retail does.
